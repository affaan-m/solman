# Risks and Assumptions

- Legal uncertainty around lootboxes and gambling: mitigated with transparent odds, provably fair, age/region gating, KYC for withdrawals.
- Fraud and multi-accounting: mitigated via device/IP hashing, velocity limits, and manual review queue.
- Onramp/KYC regional availability: fallback to alternate providers if Privy onramp is unavailable.
- RPC reliability: Helius selected to reduce rate/latency issues.
- Marketplace custodial model in MVP; Steam transfer automation is out of scope for Phase 1.
